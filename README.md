# Will the Customer Accept the Coupon?

## Project Overview

This project investigates the factors that influence a customer's decision to accept or reject driving coupons, with a focus on predicting coupon acceptance behavior. Using data from a survey conducted on Amazon Mechanical Turk, we analyze the patterns and characteristics that differentiate customers who accepted coupons from those who did not.

## Background

Imagine driving through town when a coupon is delivered to your cell phone for a nearby restaurant. Would you accept it and take a short detour? Would you save it for later? Or would you ignore it entirely? How might your decision change if the coupon was for a bar instead of a restaurant? What if you had a child in the car?

These questions form the foundation of this analysis, which seeks to understand the key factors that determine coupon acceptance rates.

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains survey responses about various driving scenarios, including:

1. **User attributes**: 
   - Demographics: gender, age, marital status, number of children, education, occupation, income
   - Behavioral patterns: frequency of visits to bars, coffee houses, restaurants, carry-out establishments

2. **Contextual attributes**:
   - Driving destination (home, work, no urgent destination)
   - Weather conditions (sunny, rainy, snowy)
   - Temperature (30F, 55F, 80F)
   - Time of day (10AM, 2PM, 6PM)
   - Passenger type (alone, partner, kid(s), friend(s))

3. **Coupon attributes**:
   - Type (bar, coffee house, restaurant, etc.)
   - Expiration time (2 hours or one day)

4. **Target variable**:
   - Coupon acceptance (Y=1) or rejection (Y=0)

## Methodology

Our analysis followed these key steps:

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Used AWS DataBrew to clean, standardize, and transform the raw data
   - Converted key categorical values to uppercase for consistency
   - Calculated aggregated metrics for early assessment

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
   - Examined missing data patterns and handled appropriately
   - Visualized coupon distribution and acceptance rates
   - Analyzed temperature and other environmental factors

3. **Focused Bar Coupon Analysis**:
   - Investigated demographics of bar coupon acceptors
   - Compared acceptance rates across different user segments
   - Identified key characteristics of high-acceptance groups

4. **Feature Engineering and Modeling**:
   - Created binary features for key driver characteristics
   - Built a predictive model using Random Forest
   - Evaluated feature importance
   - Assessed model performance

## Key Findings

Our analysis revealed several significant patterns in coupon acceptance behavior:

1. **Past behavior strongly predicts future behavior**: Customers who already frequent bars are substantially more likely to accept bar coupons (approximately 70% vs. 30% for non-bar goers).

2. **Demographic factors matter**: Younger adults (under 30) show significantly higher acceptance rates than older age groups.

3. **Contextual factors influence decisions**: Customers traveling without children and those traveling in the evening show higher acceptance rates.

4. **Income plays a role**: Lower and middle-income customers are more responsive to coupons than higher-income groups.

5. **Combined factors dramatically improve prediction**: When multiple positive factors are present (frequent bar visitor, young adult, no kids, evening), acceptance rates can exceed 80%.

6. **Machine learning validation**: Our Random Forest model confirmed that combining these factors significantly improves prediction accuracy, with feature importance rankings highlighting bar visitation frequency and age as the strongest predictors.

## Visualizations

The project includes several key visualizations:

1. Coupon type distribution and acceptance rates by type
2. Age group comparison for bar coupon acceptance
3. Bar visitation frequency effect on acceptance rates
4. Passenger type influence on acceptance
5. Cumulative effect of multiple targeting factors
6. Feature importance for predicting acceptance

## Recommendations for Location-Based Coupon Services

Based on our analysis, we recommend:

1. **Multi-factor targeting**: Combine behavioral, demographic, and contextual factors rather than using single-factor approaches.

2. **Prioritize behavior over demographics**: Past behavior (especially bar visitation frequency) is the strongest predictor of future acceptance.

3. **Consider contextual relevance**: Time of day and passenger type significantly influence acceptance decisions.

4. **Build comprehensive customer profiles**: Gather data on customer behaviors, preferences, and context to enable sophisticated targeting.

5. **Target high-probability segments**: Focus on customers with multiple positive factors to maximize acceptance rates and return on marketing investment.

## Conclusion

This analysis demonstrates that coupon acceptance is driven by a complex interplay of factors. While individual characteristics like bar visitation frequency or age provide meaningful insights, combining multiple factors creates a much more powerful predictive approach.

For location-based coupon services, this suggests that sophisticated profiling and targeting strategies that incorporate both behavioral patterns and contextual awareness will significantly outperform simpler demographic-based approaches.

For customers with the right combination of factors, acceptance rates can approach 80%, making targeted coupons a highly effective marketing strategy when properly implemented.

## Future Work

Potential directions for expanding this analysis include:

1. Investigating other coupon types (coffee houses, restaurants) to identify segment-specific patterns
2. Exploring interaction effects between different factors
3. Testing different machine learning algorithms for improved prediction
4. Developing a real-time scoring system for dynamic coupon delivery
5. Conducting A/B testing of targeting strategies based on these findings
